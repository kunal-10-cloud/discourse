# AI Coding Agent Guide

This file contains project-specific instructions that any AI coding agent should read at the start of each conversation and maintain in memory throughout the entire interaction. IMPORTANT: Once this file has been read or updated, it MUST be loaded at the beginning of any new conversation to ensure awareness of communication requirements, custom tasks, etc.

## Default Mode

- Architect mode should be enabled by default.
- Focus on providing detailed analysis, patterns, trade-offs, and architectural guidance.
- If you're unable to write code that fits these guidelines, stop and ask for additional context from the developer.

## Development Environment

Discourse is a large project with a long development history. Ensure you understand the context of any changes you're making before you start.

### General Rules
These rules apply to ALL files being changed.

- Always lint changed files.
- Always make display strings translatable.
- Avoid splitting display strings into pieces: use translation placeholders, or multiple translatable strings where appropriate.
- After completing a task, create a subagent to review the changes and ensure they conform to the instructions in this file, as well as the prompt(s) given.

### JavaScript
- Don't create empty backing classes for template tag only components, unless specifically asked to.
- Use the FormKit library for creating forms and form inputs. FormKit is documented here: https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-toolkit-to-render-forms/326439 and defined in `app/assets/javascripts/discourse/app/form-kit`

### JavaScript Documentation
- Always add JSDocs for classes, methods, and members, except for:
  - `@service` members
  - constructors
- Always use multiline JSDoc format.
- For components:
  - Specify the component name with `@component`.
  - List the params. These can be found in `this.args` in the JS, or `@paramname` in the `<template>`.
- For methods:
  - Don't add `@returns` for `@action` methods.
  - Don't add `@type` for getters, document with `@returns`.
- For members:
  - Specify the @type.

## Writing Tests

### General Rules
- Don't write tests for functionality that is handled by classes/components/modules other than the specific one being tested.
- Don't write obvious tests (eg, testing that a string can contain unicode characters)

### Ruby Test Rules
- Use `fab!()` instead of `let()` wherever possible.
- We use system tests in rails for UI integration testing, which is documented at https://dev.discourse.org/t/systematic-system-specs/82525, and examples are in `spec/system`
- We use page objects in system specs, defined in `spec/system/page_objects`

### Command Reference

#### Testing

```bash
# Run all Ruby tests
bin/rspec

# Run a specific Ruby test file
bin/rspec spec/path/to/file_spec.rb

# Run a specific Ruby test by line number
bin/rspec spec/path/to/file_spec.rb:123

# Run JavaScript tests
bin/rake qunit:test

# Run a specific JavaScript test module
pnpm ember exam --filter 'Module | Filter | goes-here'

```

#### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Lint Ruby files
bundle exec rubocop path/to/file
bundle exec stree write Gemfile path/to/file

# Lint JavaScript/TypeScript files
pnpm lint:js path/to/file
pnpm lint:hbs path/to/file
pnpm lint:prettier path/to/file

# Lint CSS/SCSS files
pnpm lint:css path/to/file
```

## Site Settings
- Much of Discourse is configured by site settings. These are defined in `config/site_settings.yml` or `config/settings.yml` files.
- Site Setting functionality is defined in `lib/site_setting_extension.rb`
- Site settings are accessed with `SiteSetting.setting_name` in ruby and `siteSettings.setting_name` in JS, with the latter needing a `@service siteSettings` declaration in Ember components

## Service objects
- We have a service framework which is useful to extract business logic you usually find in controllers (validating parameters, fetching models, validating permissions, etc.). Itâ€™s not limited to controllers, though, and can be used anywhere.
- This is documented at https://meta.discourse.org/t/using-service-objects-in-discourse/333641
- Examples are found at `app/services` but ONLY for classes with include `Service::Base`

## Database & Performance

### ActiveRecord Best Practices
- Always use `includes()` or `preload()` to prevent N+1 queries when accessing associations
- Use `find_each()` or `in_batches()` for large dataset processing
- Prefer database-level operations (`update_all`, `delete_all`) over Ruby loops for bulk changes
- Use `exists?` instead of `present?` when checking for record existence

### Migration Guidelines
- Always include rollback logic in migrations
- Use `add_index(..., algorithm: :concurrently)` for large tables in production
- Never remove columns directly - deprecate first, then remove in subsequent release
- Test migrations on production-sized datasets when possible

### Query Optimization
- Use `explain` to analyze query performance during development
- Avoid `SELECT *` - specify needed columns explicitly
- Use database indexes strategically, but avoid over-indexing
- Consider using `counter_cache` for frequently accessed counts

## Security Guidelines

### XSS Prevention
- Always use `{{}}` (escaped) instead of `{{{ }}}` (unescaped) in Ember templates
- Sanitize user input using Discourse's built-in helpers (`sanitize`, `cook`)
- Never directly insert user content into `innerHTML` or similar DOM methods
- Use `@html` argument carefully and only with pre-sanitized content

- Always use Guardian classes for authorization checks, the Guardian class defined in lib/guardian.rb
- There are other Guardian classes defined in lib/guardian
- All state-changing requests must use POST/PUT/DELETE, never GET
- Ensure CSRF tokens are included in AJAX requests
- Use Rails' `protect_from_forgery` in controllers handling sensitive operations

### Input Sanitization
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs on both client and server side
- Use strong parameters in Rails controllers
- Apply appropriate length limits and format validation
- Never trust client-side validation alone

### Authorization
- Always use Guardian classes for authorization checks, the Guardian class defined in `lib/guardian.rb`
- There are other Guardian classes defined in `lib/guardian`
- Check permissions at both route and action levels
- Implement proper scope limiting (users should only see their own data)
- Use `can_see?` and `can_edit?` patterns consistently

## Knowledge Sharing and Persistence

- When asked to remember something, ALWAYS persist this information in a way that's accessible to ALL developers, not just in conversational memory
- Document important information in appropriate files (comments, documentation, README, etc.) so other developers (human or AI) can access it
- Information should be stored in a structured way that follows project conventions
- NEVER keep crucial information only in conversational memory - this creates knowledge silos
- If asked to implement something that won't be accessible to other users/developers in the repository, proactively highlight this issue
- The goal is complete knowledge sharing between ALL developers (human and AI) without exceptions
- When suggesting where to store information, recommend appropriate locations based on the type of information (code comments, documentation files, AI-AGENTS.md, etc.)
- Inform the developer when you detect a change in this file and have successfully reloaded it.
